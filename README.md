# Fire-Risk-Prediction-of-Fairfax-County-
Fire Risk Prediction of Fairfax County using Predictive Modelling and Data Analytics 


•	Collaborated with the Fairfax county Fire department in predicting the Risk and chance of Fire Accidents. Gathered the data regarding fire incidents, inspections and collected supporting data sets from data.gov and other websites. 
•	Pre-processed the data and transformed using box-cox and nonzero variance transformations. 
•	Used different models, logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient boosting, on the data to predict the probability of occurrence of fire at the location to get an accuracy of 87.3%.
•	Plotted map graph that indicates the percentage of risk for every location with risk probability specific to the zone, using python packages such as matplotlib, sqlalchemy, pyproj, numpy, geopandas, pandas, seaborn, shapefile, and other packages.
